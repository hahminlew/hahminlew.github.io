I'm an AI Researcher at [Klleon](https://klleon.io/).

My interest is to solve data-driven valuable real-world problems through AI / ML systems, currently based on computer vision and ML engineering. Iâ€™m a curious and challenging spirit, and proactively seeking opportunities to grow and share my knowledge. My recent projects are as follows:
 - Explicit Controllable 3D Parameterized Modeling
 - Neural Talking Head Synthesis
 - Diffusion Model
 - Face & Head Swapping
 - Image Animation
