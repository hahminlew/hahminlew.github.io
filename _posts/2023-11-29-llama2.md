As described in [the previous post](https://hahminlew.github.io/nlp/llama/), LLaMA-1 emphasized open-source contributions in terms of training procedures as well as evaluations.
In this paper, Meta keeps continuing to consider open-sourcing, reproducibility, and the safety of LLMs.
They released LLAMA-2 and LLAMA-2-CHAT which are a family of pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs.
